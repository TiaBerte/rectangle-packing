To run 'SMT.py' z3 solver, numpy and matplotlib have to been installed. 'utility.py' has to be in the same 
project folder of 'SMT.py' to import some function to read data, write output file and plot the solutions.

Instance : variable contains the number of the instance to be solved.
path : contains the path of the folder with the instances file.
rot : is a boolean variable to establish if the rotation of circuits is allowed (rotation=True) or not (rotation=False).

The solution is written in a .txt file called 'out-i.txt', where 'i' is the number of the instance.
The format of the output is the one specified in the pdf project.
